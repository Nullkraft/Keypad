The Keypad library is designed for driving matrix style keypads when using the Arduino platform. It uses the standard method of selecting a column and scanning all the rows to see which key may be pressed. Support is provided for various size keypads (or matrix style keyboards) up to 160 keys with a maximum of 16 columns and 10 rows. You can expand beyond that if you are willing to make minor changes to the library.

Features of this library are:
	Allows multiple, simultaneous, keypresses. (Current max of 10 keys at one time.)
	Backwards compatible with previous single-key methods.
	Has a built-in state-machine to debounce the keys without slowing down your code.


Version 3.0 	2012-07-12 - Mark Stanley:
				Made library multi-keypress by default. (Backwards compatible)
