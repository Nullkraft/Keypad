Keypad Library for Arduino
Author:  Mark Stanley, Alexander Brevig

The Keypad library is designed for driving matrix style keypads (matrix decoder) when using the Arduino platform. It uses the standard method of selecting a column and scanning all the rows to see which key may be pressed. Support is provided for various size keypads (or matrix style keyboards) up to 160 keys with a maximum of 16 columns and 10 rows. You can expand beyond that if you are willing to make minor changes to the library.

Features of this library are:
	Allows multiple, simultaneous, keypresses. (Current max of 10 keys at one time.)
	Backwards compatible with previous single-key methods.
	Has a built-in state-machine to debounce the keys without slowing down your code.

Version 3.2 	2015-08-17 - Tim Trzepacz:
        Added "stated" event listener that also receives key state as a parameter.
